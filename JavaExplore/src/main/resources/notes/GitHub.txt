Commit\Push the code into Git Hub
---------------------------------
Open up the Command Line and change directory until you’re inside the icecream folder, where your designs are stored.

> cd ~/icecream
Next, initialize Git so you can start using Git commands inside the folder. The folder is now a Git repository.

> git init
Wait, this is the right folder, right? Here’s how you check and make sure this is where you stored your design:

> git status
And this is what Git will tell you in reply:

There they are! Add them to your local Git repository so they’ll be tracked by Git.

> git add chocolate.jpeg
Now, take a “snapshot” of the repository as it stands now with the commit command:

> git commit -m “Add chocolate.jpeg.”
Great! But your co-workers, hard at work in their own local repositories, can’t see your fantastic new design. That’s because the main project is stored in the company GitHub account (username: 123WebDesign) in the repository called “icecream.”

Since you haven’t connected to the GitHub repo yet, your computer doesn’t even know this exists. So tell your local repository about it:

> git remote add origin https://github.com/123WebDesign/icecream.git
And double check to make sure it knows:

> git remote -v
Finally, it’s the moment you’ve been waiting for. Upload that delicious looking sundae up to the project:

> git push
